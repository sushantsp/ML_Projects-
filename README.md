1) Car Brand Recognition (Using Transfer Learning)

Three car brands were used for classification, namely Audi, Lamborghini, Mercedes.
Resnet50 architechture was used for purpose of classification. Main purpose of implementing this project
was to use keras inbuilt transfer learning architecture. No traninig was done to the model for the given image 
datasets. 

Traninig Accuracy of 95% with test accuracy of 86 % was achieved.
